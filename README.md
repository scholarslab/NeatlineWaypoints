# NeatlineWaypoints

NeatlineWaypoints makes it possible to add an list of clickable "waypoints" to an exhibit. Waypoints can be put into a specific order, making it possible to guide users through an exhibit in a linear sequence.

## Installation

  1. Download the latest version of the plugin from the Omeka add-ons repository.

  1. Uncompress the `.zip` archive.

  2. Move the `NeatlineWaypoints` into the `/plugins` folder in you Omeka installation.

  3. In the Omeka administrative interface, click on **Plugins** in the top navigation bar and find the listing for "Neatline Widget ~ Waypoints". Click on "Install."

  **Note**: Since NeatlineWaypoints is a "sub-plugin" that extends the core functionality of Neatline (itself a plugin), Neatline has to be installed in order to install NeatlineWaypoints.

## Usage

### Enabling the widget

NeatlineWaypoints adds a "widget" to your installation of Neatline that can be turned on and off for each individual exhibit. Widgets can be activated when an exhibit is first created or by clicking on the "Exhibit Settings" link for an exhibit in the main browse view, which opens the same form that is dispalyed when the exhibit is created. In either case:

  1. Scroll down to the "Widgets" field. Click on the input box to display a list of available widgets.

  2. Click on the listing for "Waypoints." Once selected, the listing will be displayed as a box in the input.

  3. To add the widget, click "Save Exhibit" at the bottom of the form.

### Adding waypoints

Once you've enabled the widget for an exhibit, individual records can be added to the waypoints panel, a small list of record titles displayed at the top right of the screen:

  1. Open the edit form for the record you want to add to the list of waypoints.

  2. Open the **Style** tab and find the "Widgets" field in the "Groups" field set.

  3. Activate the "Waypoints" option.

  4. Click the "Save" button at the bottom of the form.

As soon as a record is added, the list of waypoints will automatically update to include the new listing.

### Ordering waypoints

To change the order of the listings in the waypoints panel, click on the **Plugins** tab in the editor and select the **Waypoints** in the drop-down menu. To change the order, just click on any of the waypoints in the list and drag it up or down. When you're done, click the "Save" button to commit the change.
